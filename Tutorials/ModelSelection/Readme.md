# Model Selection


In the first two tutorials you have learned to download sequences from Genbank and align and concatenate them to create a multi-gene dataset. You also heard about differences between file formats and saw how to create the needed formats. For the next tutorial, we are going to use *ModelFinder* to find the best partitioning scheme for our dataset and also the best models for each partition.

First remember that our final dataset, `ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy` was formed by 4 genes and you saved it as a PHYLIP format with the extension `.phy`. Now open *Aliview* and open this file. You should have something similar to this:

<p align="center"><img src="../../Tutorials/ModelSelection/Aliview7.png" alt="Aliview7" width="900"></p>

Then from the menu, select: `File`-> `Save as Nexus` and don't change the file name when saving. You should have these two files now:

```
ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy
ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.nexus
```

For substution model selection we are going to use the `ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy` and a command file that we are going to create together. 

## Choosing the right substitution model

We will use ModelFinder ([Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4285)), as implemented in [IQ-TREE3](http://www.iqtree.org) ([Nguyen et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/1/268/2925592)), to determine the best-fit model. 

<!--IQ-TREE3 for Windows, MacOSX and Linux can be downloaded [here](http://www.iqtree.org/#download), you can install it on your personal computer.-->

ModelFinder chooses the model that minimizes the BIC score (you can also change the selection criteria to AIC or AICc by adding the option -AIC or -AICc, respectively).

You will need a partition file either in NEXUS or RAxML-style formats, like the examples below: 

The RAxML-style partition file may look like:

```
 DNA, part1 = 1-69 
 DNA, part2 = 70-666
```

Nexus-style partition file may look like:

```
#nexus
begin sets;
    charset part1 = 1-69; 
    charset part2 = 70-666;
end;
```

You should have this partition file from Tutorial 2. It should be called `Gene_partitions.txt`. Make sure you are in the folder with your data file (alignment) and the partition file.

### Running ModelFinder with IQ-TREE

<!--

Once we have the parition file, we need to locate where our downloaded IQ-TREE folder (or a compressed file named like `iqtree-3.1.1-XXXX.zip`). If you have a compressed file, you should uncompress it first. Inside that folder, there should be another folder named `bin/` go to that folder.

Make sure that you have moved the data and the partition file into this folder.

Then follow the steps listed below according to your operating system.

**If you use MacOS**: You can right click (while holding the option key) that `bin` folder and select `Copy as pathname`. Then launch your Terminal app and type `cd` and paste. You should see a command-line like this:

```
cd /Users/yourName/Downloads/iqtree-3.1.1-MacOSX/bin
```
 
Of course, depending on where you have your folder, your user name, your IQ-TREE version, it will look slightly different. Then, hit enter.

**If you use Windows 11**: You can right click any empty space within the  `bin` folder and select `Open in Terminal`


Now that we located the folder, we can start using the program. We will start by typing the following command and running it by hitting enter.

-->

Type the following command and run it.

```
iqtree3 -s ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy -p Gene_partitions.txt -m TESTMERGEONLY --prefix first

```
<!--

If you are a Windows user and cannot successfully run the above command, try using the `\` character instead of `/`.

-->

Here, we are:
- selecting the best-fit model for the alignment `-s ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy`,
- with its partitions (genes in this case) defined in `-p Gene_partitions.txt` file,
- by possibly merging partitions `-m TESTMERGEONLY` to reduce over-parameterization and increase model fit. 
- saving all generated files from this run to files that all have names starting with `--prefix first`.

Above settings for model selection will only consider the invariable site and Gamma rate heterogeneity. If you want to consider the FreeRate heterogeneity model too, then run:

```
iqtree3 -s ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy -p Gene_partitions.txt -m MF+MERGE --prefix second

```

As a third option, if you want to restrict your model search to only those models supported by a specific program (Mr Bayes in our case), then run:
```
iqtree3 -s ATP6_COI_CytB_ND5.phy -p Gene_partitions.txt -m TESTMERGEONLY -mset mrbayes --prefix third

```

If you are in this section, well done! now you have several files with the selected best-fit model for our dataset.

Questions:

1. Compare the three files that you should see now that all end with `.best_scheme.nex`. These will include the estimated best partitioning schemes and the best fit models for them. Are there any differences?
